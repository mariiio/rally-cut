# Custom ByteTrack config for beach volleyball player tracking
# Optimized for stable tracking with minimal ID switches
# Beach volleyball-tuned: shorter rallies, fewer players, larger movements

tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection thresholds - tuned to reduce fragmented tracks
# Beach volleyball has only 4 players, higher thresholds prevent weak detections from fragmenting
track_high_thresh: 0.35  # First-stage match threshold (raised to reduce fragmentation)
track_low_thresh: 0.12   # Second-stage recovery threshold (raised)
new_track_thresh: 0.45   # Threshold for new tracks (raised to prevent noise)

# Longer buffer for track persistence (~3 seconds at 30fps)
# Handles temporary occlusions and cross-rally continuity
track_buffer: 90  # Increased to 3 seconds

# Slightly lower match threshold for more associations
match_thresh: 0.80

# Fuse detection score with motion for more stable tracking
fuse_score: True
