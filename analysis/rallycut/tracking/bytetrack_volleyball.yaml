# Custom ByteTrack config for beach volleyball player tracking
# Optimized for stable tracking with minimal ID switches
# Beach volleyball-tuned: shorter rallies, fewer players, larger movements

tracker_type: bytetrack

# Detection thresholds - tuned for better recall
# Lower thresholds recover more detections, filtering handles false positives
track_high_thresh: 0.25  # First-stage match threshold (lowered for recall)
track_low_thresh: 0.08   # Second-stage recovery threshold (lowered)
new_track_thresh: 0.35   # Threshold for new tracks (lowered)

# Longer buffer for track persistence (~3 seconds at 30fps)
# Handles temporary occlusions and cross-rally continuity
track_buffer: 90  # Increased to 3 seconds

# Slightly lower match threshold for more associations
match_thresh: 0.80

# Fuse detection score with motion for more stable tracking
fuse_score: True
