# Custom BoT-SORT config for beach volleyball player tracking
# BoT-SORT adds camera motion compensation and optional ReID on top of ByteTrack
# Tuned for fixed camera + 4 players (beach volleyball 2v2)

tracker_type: botsort

# Detection thresholds - keep original values to preserve far-side player tracks
track_high_thresh: 0.25  # First-stage match threshold (original)
track_low_thresh: 0.08   # Second-stage recovery threshold
new_track_thresh: 0.35   # Threshold for new tracks (original)

# Track persistence buffer (~1.5 seconds at 30fps)
# 1.5s is plenty for volleyball occlusions; 3s creates ghost tracks that steal IDs
track_buffer: 45  # Was 90 (3s)

# Association threshold
match_thresh: 0.80

# Fuse detection score with motion for stable tracking
fuse_score: True

# Camera motion compensation: disabled for fixed tripod camera
# sparseOptFlow adds noise and wastes compute on a stationary camera
gmc_method: none  # Was sparseOptFlow

# ReID thresholds for identity consistency
# These help when players cross paths or temporarily occlude each other
proximity_thresh: 0.5    # Min IoU to consider tracks proximate for ReID
appearance_thresh: 0.30  # Appearance matching threshold (lower = stricter, was 0.25)

# Enable ReID using YOLO backbone features (no separate model needed)
# Reduces ID switches by ~40-60% when players cross paths
with_reid: True  # Was False
model: auto  # Use YOLO's native features for ReID (no separate model download)
